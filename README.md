The whole project focusses mainly on Smart Waste collection system which primarily consists of IoT enabled bins connected to a centraized processing server which in turn gets readings of bins throughout a city. After being passes through Route Optimization (CVRO) algorithm which optimizes the path for the collection vehicle reducing the fuel consumption and time spent. This model has a great potential if developed with association from the Governemt and social authorities.
